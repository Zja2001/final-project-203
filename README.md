CS203 final project

1. Why you are proud (or not proud) of your project

Zach has always been a fan of videogames so to even makes a text based game is really cool to think about.

2. Points of frustration and/or relief (if any) 

Definitely getting the priority queue to work the way it should (they way we wanted). We ended up realizing that the initial implementation didn't
work as expected after running the program with a break point, and we had to go back and modify the code to make sure it worked.

3. Software 

Just Java in an IDE

4. Abstract of the project

We have a text-based dungeon crawler game that Zach made in his CS101 class, and then refined in CS202. We're adding a data structure (Priority Queue)
to allow us to implement a second character as well as a speed stat concept which will determine the turn order the players take

5. Goals of the project

To improve of a game Zach made back in cs 101 by adding priority queues to the battle system and adding a second player

6. Why you chose to implement this

Originally the game only had one player so for it to have 2 players is a large step towards a more complete game

7. What your project does and how it does it

It is a standard dungeon crawler with 2 players and with re-playability. It is able to achieve this through lost of methods int passing and priority
queues and priority queues for the battle system.

8. How the algorithm/technology/mechanism works in real implementation

The priority queues compare the speed stats of all characters involved and whoever has the highest speed stat goes first.

9. Why people use this particular algorithm, why not anything else 

Priority queues were best for the job because it was the simplest and lowest resource way to compare multiple stats at once an push out a result 

10. What core characteristics your software (or something you have implemented) has

A turn based roleplaying videogame 

11. Anything else you feel like would be nice to add

none
